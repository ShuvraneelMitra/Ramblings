> Once upon a time, Toma found himself in a binary cafe. It is a very popular and unusual place.
> 
> 
> 
> The cafe offers visitors $k$ different delicious desserts. The desserts are numbered from $0$ to $k−1$. The cost of the $i$-th dessert is $2^i$ coins, because it is a binary cafe! Toma is willing to spend no more than $n$ coins on tasting desserts. At the same time, he is not interested in buying any dessert more than once, because one is enough to evaluate the taste.
> 
> 
> 
> In how many different ways can he buy several desserts (possibly zero) for tasting?
